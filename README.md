# clang-compat-utils

These are accompanying scripts I use for maintaining and using the
[clang-compat] configurations for use with the Paludis package manager.

They are not required in order to use clang-compat, and these are
mostly just things I use to make my life easier since I'm the person
upkeeping this unblessed mess.

An exheres to install this can be found in [::somasis].
